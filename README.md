# Odin Projects

This repo is for projects from The [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) which teaches Front-end & Full-stack development
All projects can be easily viewed from light menu [here](https://bushenzie.github.io/odin-projects/)

**NOTE**
All projects are made just to train and are not meant to be viewed as fully functional projects.
There is no responsive design implemented due to just focusing on thing in curriculum
