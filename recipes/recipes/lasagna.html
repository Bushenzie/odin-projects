    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package pancetta, minced</li>
        <li>7 ounces ground beef</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups plain tomato sauce</li>
        <li>⅓ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>⅓ cup gluten-free all-purpose baking flour</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring and mashing meat into small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. Add tomato sauce and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.       </li>
    </ol>
